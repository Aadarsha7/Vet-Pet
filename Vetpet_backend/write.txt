Digital Dreams
Verse 1
Staring at the screen until the morning light
Code and coffee fuel another sleepless night
Building worlds from nothing but imagination
Lines of text become my heart's creation
Chorus
We're living in digital dreams
Where nothing's quite the way it seems
But every bug we learn to fix
Makes us stronger in the mix
Digital dreams, digital dreams
We're more than algorithms and machines
Verse 2
Error messages like puzzle pieces scattered
Sometimes I wonder if my sanity has shattered
But then the program runs, the system comes alive
And suddenly I remember why I strive
Chorus
We're living in digital dreams
Where nothing's quite the way it seems
But every bug we learn to fix
Makes us stronger in the mix
Digital dreams, digital dreams
We're more than algorithms and machines
Bridge
From zeros and ones to something beautiful
From broken code to something meaningful
We're artists painting with electric light
Turning darkness into something bright
Final Chorus
We're living in digital dreams
Where magic flows through data streams
Every problem that we solve
Helps the future to evolve
Digital dreams, digital dreams
We're building tomorrow with our schemes
Outro
So here's to all the dreamers typing through the night
You're creating wonders hidden from plain sight
